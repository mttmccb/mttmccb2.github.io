My main blog over on [mttmccb](http://mttmccb.net) was becoming frustrating when it comes to blogs heavy on coding, sadly this is a limitation of Squarespace. It's focus is on designer, not developers, so I'm going to move most of the code heavy posts on to this site to reduce friction in writing more.

I'm a full-stack developer and am equally at home with databases as I am with the browser. I still have a lot to learn and will share as I go along. I've had blogs in the past that have fizzled out but I hope to keep this one going longer.

## What's up with the name?

I spent a little bit of my youth and a lot of my money on Magic: The Gathering and the Rabid Wombat card always stuck with me. In the last few years I've found myself accidently on the bleeding edge, either because I'm doing something that hasn't been done or not many people have. Canary is the name for Google's early builds of Chrome so I though why not go for Rabid Canary.

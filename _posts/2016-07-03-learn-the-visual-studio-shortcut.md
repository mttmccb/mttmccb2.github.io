There seems to be an increasing number of useful extensions. [Learn the shortcut](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/29f07f2c-68aa-47fa-b1c3-48065209b110) helps you to learn by showing what shortcut you could have used.

It does this by

- Displaying the keyboard shortcut in the status bar
- Keeping a log in a separate Output Window pane

There are options to auto-hide and ignore those shortcuts you *did* use. Very handy and I think it's something you could review at the end of the day and see which shortcuts you're not using most of the time and save yourself a bit of time.

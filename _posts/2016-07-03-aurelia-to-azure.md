Some handy tips from [Wes Shaddix](http://www.wesshaddix.com/2015/11/24/deploying-a-production-aurelia-app-to-azure/) on how he deploys an app to production. It's not that far away from how I did it.

Just replace bitbucket with GitHub and add [some redirection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32114794/configure-iis-server-to-work-with-aurelia-framework-and-push-state/32117532#32117532) to make pushstate work a bit better.

The time it takes for the deployment to happen azure is a bit so but so far I've only used the free tier.

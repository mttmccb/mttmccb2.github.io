At some point next year I'll be moving my [mttmccb.net](http://mttmccb.net) over to GitHub pages, Squarespace is currently lacking the performance I need.

I had a look at how this site performs and I was pleasantly surprised there weren't any major issues. I did however take the time to optimize all the images.

[Chris Hallahan](http://chrishallahan.com/2015/12/28/pass-google-pagespeed-performance-test.html) goes into what he did to achieve the highest score he could.

I could look into asynchronously loading my CSS and doing a bit of work to inline critical CSS. Alternatively I might look at CloudFlare.

However this site is already pretty snappy, I've avoided large images and static files.
